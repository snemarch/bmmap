# bmmap

A tool for visualizing the scraped data from the (closed) **blackmarket.dk** site.
Unlikely to be of interest to you if you didn't use my other tool to scrape
the site :-)

This project currently consists of Go code to massage the contacts data into
JSON, and a tiny webapp for visualizing contacts using [vis.js](http://visjs.org).
